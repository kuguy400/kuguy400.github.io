How to create a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website

<p id="MainParagraph">
When you want to create a website, there are many ways to do so.
There are website creating platforms (wix.com, Google Sites, and Weebly), that are fairly easy to make websites on.
All you need to do is create text boxes where you want them and, you can put content there.
Then there are ways to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as raw code to create a website. 
You can write Raw code on many different platforms.
Some of these platforms include github.io (what we are using this to create a website) and various other sites. 
*This website is using raw code to create a website*

  <p id = "UL1title">The three coding languages that we used for this website are:</p>
 <ul id="UL1">
  <li>html</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
 </ul>

  <p id="ExtraHtml" > Html stands for hypertext markup language and is the building blocks of a website. To begin coding with html, you have to understand the basic style of html. Html looks something along the lines of this:
< c o d e >  t e x t  < / c o d e >. The greater-than and less-than symbols surround different commands or types of headings (and / is typically used in the closing command). In addition, you typically put text in between the two commands. For example: < p >  H e l l o !  < / p > 
  </p> 

  </div>
<div>
  <p id="ExtraHtml"> Now that you know the basics you can set up your document. The first thing you will do is type in: < ! D O C T Y P E h t m l >. This tells the coding software that you are using html. The next thing you will type in is: < h t m l > < / h t m l>. You will place your html code in-between these two tags. Third, you will type in:  < h e a d >  < t i t l e > (whatever you want your title to be) < t i t l e> < h e a d> in the html tags. This changes the label on the tabs at the top of your browser (for your website). Next, you add divisions or < d i v > (add more code here) < / d i v >, in order to separate a specific section, and you can add whatever you want	 inside, from headers ( < h 1 >, < h 2 >, < h3 >, etc.) to paragraphs ( < p > ), to images and videos. You can even make more divisions. It’s up to you! </p>

         <p id="CSS"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. 
           It is used to add on to your html, and allows you to use different fonts and font sizes, colors, spacing, 
           images, videos, transparency and more. It essentially allows you to add aesthetics and design to your website.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p id="CSS"> The first thing you have to do with css, is link your CSS code to your html code. You do this by putting in the following in your html: < l i n k  h r e f = " . / s t y l e . c s s "   t y p e = " t e x t / c s s "   \ r e l = " s t y l e s h e e t" > .  The next thing you will do, is use a specific selector to find a particular part of your html that you want to have specific attributes. For example you could use a broad selector like p for paragraph, which would change all paragraphs accordingly or something more narrow in which case you will need to add a class or an ID to an html tag. A class looks like this: < p class=”whateveryouwanttoputhere” > hi < p >. An ID looks like this: < p id=”hEllOhumanz” > potato < p >. After you add your class or ID, you will go back to your CSS code and use whatever you put in the parenthesis of your class/ID as a selector. You can even use the same ID/class for different parts of your html. When you are typing CSS, you write out your selector and then two braces. EX: p {}. When using a class you put a . in front of its name, and for an ID you put a #. Ex: #hEllOhumanz {} or .hEllOhumanz {}. Finally, inside the braces you can add elements, like color, font size, padding, margins, and more. Ex: #hEllOhumanz {font-size: 2px; color: red;}

Javascript is used to make websites interactive. You can use a seperate page to code Javascript, or you can use built in Javascript in html. If you use a separate page, you will need to link it. The basics of javascript is var. Var is used to hold information. For example you would say (var pizzaSlicePerPie = 8). PizzaSlicePerPie is holding the amount 8. Another key component of Javascript is the ability to do math, specifically algebra in the code. For example you would do (8 += 5) to do 8 + 5. With javascript you are able to add buttons. A button can be used to change different thing. (Ex. It would be able to change white text to green text). Javascript is not needed to create a website, but it is highly recommended.
