  <p id="+Html" Html stands for hypertext markup language and is the building blocks of a website. To start up you have to understand the basic style of html. Html looks something along the lines of this:
<code> text </code>. The greater-than and less-than symbols surround different commands or types of headings (and / is typically used in the closing command). In addition, you typically put text in between the two commands. For example: <p> Hello! </p>
