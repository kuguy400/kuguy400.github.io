  Getting Started

<p>
  When you want to create a website, there are many ways to do so. There are website creating platforms
  (wix.com, google sites, and weebly), are fairly easy to make websites on.
  All you need to do is create textboxes where you want them and, you can put content there. 
  Then there are ways to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as raw code to create a website. 
  You can write Raw code on many different platforms. Some of these platforms include github(what I am using this to create website),
  Code Acadamy, and various other sites. *This website is over using raw code to create a website*
