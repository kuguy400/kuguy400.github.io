<p id="MainParagraph">
When you want to create a website, there are many ways to do so.
There are website creating platforms (wix.com, Google Sites, and Weebly), are fairly easy to make websites on.
All you need to do is create text boxes where you want them and, you can put content there.
Then there are ways to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript as raw code to create a website. 
You can write Raw code on many different platforms.
Some of these platforms include github.io (what we are using this to create a website) and various other sites. 
*This website is using raw code to create a website*

 <ul id="UL1">
  <li>html</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>

  <p id="ExtraHtml" > Html stands for hypertext markup language and is the building blocks of a website. To begin coding with html, you have to understand the basic style of html. Html looks something along the lines of this:
< c o d e >  t e x t  < / c o d e >. The greater-than and less-than symbols surround different commands or types of headings (and / is typically used in the closing command). In addition, you typically put text in between the two commands. For example: < p >  H e l l o !  < / p > 
  </p>

  <p id="ExtraHtml"> Now that you know the basics you can set up your document. The first thing you will do is type in: < ! D O C T Y P E h t m l >. This tells the coding software that you are using html. The next thing you will type in is: < h t m l > < / h t m l>. You will place your html code in-between these two tags. Third, you will type in:  < h e a d >  < t i t l e > (whatever you want your title to be) < t i t l e> < h e a d> in the html tags. This changes the label on the tabs at the top of your browser (for your website). Next, you add divisions or < d i v > (add more code here) < / d i v >, in order to separate a specific section, and you can add whatever you want	 inside, from headers ( < h 1 >, < h 2 >, < h3 >, etc.) to paragraphs ( < p > ), to images and videos. You can even make more divisions. Itâ€™s up to you! </p>

         <p id="CSS"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. 
           It is used to add on to your html, and allows you to use different fonts and font sizes, colors, spacing, 
           images, videos, transparency and more. It essentially allows you to add aesthetics and design to your website.
