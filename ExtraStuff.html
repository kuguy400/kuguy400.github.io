    <h3>Why We Chose This Topic<h3>
  </div>
      <div>
        <p id="CSS">We chose this topic because our science teacher in 6th grade made everyone in the grade learn how to code and program on "Swift" and varous other basic coding programs. 
          We thought "Swift" was OK, but we wanted to try something different. Something a bit more useful and interesting. The end result is what you are looking at right now, a website.</p>
